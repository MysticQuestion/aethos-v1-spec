# AETHOS V1 — COMPLIANCE & NON-CLAIMS FRAMEWORK

## 0) Purpose

Aethos is a symbolic analytics engine.

It does not:
- predict concrete events
- diagnose mental health conditions
- provide medical, legal, or financial advice
- guarantee outcomes
- claim supernatural causality

This document defines the compliance posture, non-claims boundaries, and language governance rules for V1.

This is not decorative.  
This is operational policy.

---

### V1 Non-Claims Language

> Aethos provides symbolic timing analysis for personal reflection purposes only.

---

## 3) App Store Compliance (Apple / Google)

### 3.1 Required Characteristics

To remain compliant:

- No deterministic claims (“this will happen”)
- No crisis intervention positioning
- No medicalized mental health claims
- No financial forecasting
- No targeting of vulnerable populations
- No implying supernatural certainty

The following phrases are banned in product copy:

- “This will happen”
- “You will meet”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Destined”
- “Fate says”
- “You must”
- “Avoid disaster”
- “Win money”
- “Health risk”
- “Diagnosis”

---

## 4) Interpretation Language Policy

### 4.1 Allowed Framing

Interpretations must use:

- “This activation may correlate with…”
- “You may notice themes around…”
- “This period can be supportive for…”
- “Consider reflecting on…”
- “Patterns involving… may be more noticeable.”

Language must:

- Suggest, not assert.
- Invite reflection, not command action.
- Avoid predictive tone.

---

### 4.2 Tone Standards

Interpretation tone must be:

- Analytical
- Neutral
- Non-directive
- Non-fear-based
- Non-catastrophic

No:
- Doom language
- Spiritual superiority
- Absolutism
- Emotional manipulation

---

## 5) Mental Health Boundary

Aethos must not:

- Diagnose anxiety, depression, trauma, etc.
- Suggest clinical intervention
- Replace therapy

Permitted:
- “If you are experiencing distress, consider speaking with a licensed professional.”
- A static resources link page (optional V1).

No:
- Real-time crisis advice
- Suicide risk detection claims
- Therapy simulation claims

---

## 6) Financial & Legal Boundary

Aethos must not:

- Suggest investment timing
- Provide tax guidance
- Suggest legal strategies
- Offer risk-avoidance claims

Even if users journal about finances, the engine remains symbolic.

---

## 7) Medical & Health Boundary

Aethos must not:

- Suggest medical procedures
- Predict illness
- Provide dietary prescriptions
- Claim physiological impact

Even if astrology traditions reference health houses, V1 excludes health interpretations entirely.

---

## 8) Advertising & Marketing Constraints

Marketing must not claim:

- “Scientifically proven destiny insights”
- “Backed by quantum physics” (unless rigorously documented, which V1 does not claim)
- “AI predicts your life events”

Permitted marketing language:

- “Deterministic astronomical calculations”
- “Structured timing analytics”
- “Multi-system symbolic integration”
- “Privacy-first reflective engine”

---

## 9) Data Privacy Commitments

V1 Commitments:

- Birth data encrypted at rest
- Journal notes encrypted at rest
- No sale of personal data
- No third-party data brokers
- Minimal analytics collection

Explicit statement to include:

> Aethos does not sell or broker personal data. Your birth data and journal entries remain under your control.

---

## 10) Ethical Interpretation Boundary

Aethos must not:

- Encourage dependency
- Imply spiritual authority over user autonomy
- Frame timing as deterministic fate

Engine principle:

Symbolic activations represent patterns, not causes.

---

## 11) Compliance Review Checklist (Pre-Release)

Before shipping any new interpretation module:

- [ ] Non-claims language present in onboarding
- [ ] Copy scanned for banned phrases
- [ ] No deterministic verbs
- [ ] No health or financial claims
- [ ] Privacy statement accessible
- [ ] No emotionally manipulative tone
- [ ] No “fear hooks” in push notifications

---

## 12) AI Usage Disclosure (If Applicable)

If AI generates interpretation summaries:

Include:

> Interpretations may be generated using automated systems and are intended for reflection purposes only.

Do NOT imply:
- Sentience
- Spiritual channeling
- Predictive authority

---

## 13) Legal Risk Mitigation Strategy

To reduce liability:

- Keep interpretations descriptive, not prescriptive
- Separate calculation engine from language layer
- Log engine settings per payload (auditability)
- Version every output
- Avoid emotionally charged predictions

---

## 14) Foundational Position

Aethos treats symbolic systems as:

Cultural meaning frameworks  
+ deterministic astronomical computation  
+ user-consented longitudinal reflection

It does not claim metaphysical certainty.

---

## 15) Open Questions (Resolve Before Public Launch)

1) Do we include health-related house descriptions in V1? (Recommended: No.)
2) Do we allow financial reflection prompts? (Recommended: Yes, but non-directive.)
3) Do we include crisis resources page? (Optional but low risk.)
