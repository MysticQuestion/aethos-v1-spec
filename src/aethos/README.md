# Aethos Calculation Layer (Scaffold)

This directory contains early architectural modules aligned with the Aethos V1 specification.

Important:
- Code here is specification-aligned scaffolding.
- Not production hardened.
- Ephemeris accuracy, timezone handling, and validation must be verified before deployment.

Principles:
- One canonical birth input
- Deterministic computation
- Layered system separation
- No interpretive coupling inside calculation modules
